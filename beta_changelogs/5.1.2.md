# 5.1.2-rc2

This is the second release candidate for 5.1.2.

The only change in this version is that all of last week's 1.20.5 pre-release
versions are marked as compatible with the map.

This allows people to check that nothing broke in the last view Minecraft
pre-releases.

## Changelog
- Marked data pack format 40 and 41 as supported

# 5.1.2-rc1

This is the first (and hopefully only) Release Candidate for 5.1.2, bringing
some bug fixes and updated translator credits.

## Changelog
- Updated Translator Credits
  - Removed some blank lines from translator credit signs
  - Removed hacky 5th line on some translator credit signs
  - Translator credits are now ordered by number of contributions if there are
  multiple contributors for a language
- Simplified blue leather boots check in 1.20.5 snapshots (using 1.20.5-pre1
features)
- Player heads now load based on the player UUID when using 1.20.5, so they will
continue working even after username changes

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed datapack not loading due to worldgen changes in 24w13a and later (#219)
- Fixed new points race goal announcing an arbitrary team as winner (#223)
- Fixed Powdered snow not being replaced by a save block properly (#221)
- Fixed Team selection buttons don't work in 1.20.5 snapshots (#220)
- Fixed player heads not loading in 1.20.5 snapshot
- Fixed some /trigger commands not getting deactivated when joining the skybox
or joining the game late as a spectator
- Fixed Item Frame using an outdated texture in HUD card (#222)

# 5.1.2-pre1

This is the first pre-release for version 5.1.2. This version is compatible with
1.20.5 snapshots (until 24w12a, 24w13a is not supported yet) and brings some
additional bug fixes and quality of live improvements

## Changelog
- Added support for 1.20.5
  - Known issue: player heads do not load their skins in the current snapshot
  - 24w13a does not load
- Added points scoreboard on the right (1.20.3+ only)
- Added points race goal
- Added option to join as spectator during game
- Added an error message when attempting to run in an unknown future version
- Added an error message when running on Spigot or Paper

### Points scoreboard
During the game, the points of each team are now shown on the right

![points_scoreboard.png](/images/5.1.2/points_scoreboard.png)

The own team shows up in bold.

This feature is only available from Minecraft versions 1.20.3 and onward and is
disabled in earlier 1.20 versions.

### Points Race
The points race is a new mode, where you set a certain cut-off time and when
that time is over, the team(s) with the highest score win. It can be a nice
balance when you don't like going for all items in a potentially very long run,
but also consider a Bingo too fast.

This also helps for keeping track of the 25 minute challenge in weekly seeds.

## Translations
- Added Korean Translations by 쪼상 (wx2htkd)

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed spawning over flowing lava leading to a potential death loop (#210)
- Fixed fire spreading during the skybox phase
- Fixed spawning in powdered snow without a save block
- Fixed card frames sometimes starting to pop off in the skybox
- Fixed a sign in the lobby sometimes popping off when relogging.
