## Item Changes

### Lodestone
- New category
- Only available when playing 1.21.5
- Added Lodestone
  - was changed in 1.21.5 to use an iron ingot instead of netherite
- Added Lodestone compass
  - Also mutually exclusive with compass and map
  - Likelihood is split with compass in that category, making map still as
    likely as before

### Swamp
- New Category
- Only available when playing 1.21.5
- Contains existing items: slime ball, sticky piston, leash and poison arrow
- Added firefly bush

### Warm Biomes
- Added dead bush to this category (previously only categorized as "shearable")
- Added Cactus Flower
  - Only available when playing 1.21.5
- Added Short dry grass
  - Only available when playing 1.21.5
  - Also added to the shearables category

### Miscellaneous
- Added blue egg
  - Only available when playing 1.21.5
  - Mutually exclusive with other egg items
  - Shares probability with normal egg
- Replaced pale moss block with pale moss carpet
  - This is to make it easier to distinguish from tuff and other gray blocks
- Replaced moss carpet with moss block
  - Cannot be found in mangrove swamps, and only shipwreck food chests and lush
    caves

## Worldgen
- Made armadillos more likely in badlands in 1.21.5
  - Badlands can now spawn some warm farm animal variations, were previously
    only armadillos could spawn
  - This was adjusted the same way as savanna previously, meaning armadillos
    take up a bit over half the peaceful spawns in these biomes
- Worldgen is updated to match 1.21.5 when playing in this version
  - Most notably, pale gardens spawn about twice as often now

## Technical changes
- Removed `fetchr:negated_component` item_test
- Added `fetchr:component_exists` item_test
- Category lists now support a mixed typed list

### `fetchr:component_exists` item_test
New item test that can bes specified in the item pool to check for an item
component to exist

- Requires the item component to exist on this item, with any contents
- `id` - The item component id
- `negated` - Optional. When set to `true`, requires the component to **not**
	exist (same as previous `fetchr:negated_component`)

### Heterogeneously typed category lists
When registering items, category lists can now be heterogeneous in 1.21.5 (in
1.21.4, this would be an SNBT syntax error)

This means instead of specifying a compound with only an id and no weight, you
can now always specify a string, even when there is another compound in the same
list

For example, `[ {id: "fetchr:pumpkin" }, {id: "fetchr:egg", weight: 2 } ]` can
now be written as `[ "fetchr:pumpkin", {id: "fetchr:egg", weight: 2 } ]`

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed lockout mode automatically being disabled when playing with one team
  causing the colored card backgrounds of unlocked items to not show up properly
- Fixed error chat spam not showing up when playing in a version that's too old
