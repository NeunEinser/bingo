# 5.0-rc3

A third release candidate has been released to fix a bug causing signs to not
have the correct text

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed signs not having the correct text in single player, depending on timing
- Fixed signs not having the correct text in multi player until a player goes
back to the lobby

# 5.0-rc2

A second release candidate has been released to fix a bug causing players to
fall through the world during the resource pack check owing to a misplaced
button.  
This release candidate also includes some text changes, mainly changing the
branding from Minecraft Bingo to Fetchr.

## Changelog
- Changed Branding from Minecraft Bingo to Fetchr

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Players falling through the world during resource pack check
- Fixed buttons in lobby not being replaced correctly in case they were broken

# 5.0-rc1

This is the first and hopefully only release candidate. If no major issues are
found, this will be the version released as full 5.0 release.
If there is anything you think is behaving weirdly or unexpectedly, even if it
has been like that for a while, please do report it to me. The bug tracker can
be found here: https://github.com/NeunEinser/bingo/issues. You can also just
send my a message on Discord or Twitter (Twitter DMs are open) or any other
channel.

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Changelog
- Below the Bingo spawn point there is now a dirt block pillar instead of only a
single dirt block, in case the spawnpoint is not suitable otherwise
- Optimization: Reduced network traffic within the Bingo Lobby. (#130)
- Bug Fixes

## Lobby Optimization

Signs are frequently replaced with air and then with the sign again. This is
mostly done to work around [MC-162441](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-162441)
and prevent players from seeing translation keys on signs caused by the
resourcepack loading late.

In previous versions, this was done every game tick for all signs. This caused a
lot of network traffic on servers, since the data of all signs was send to all
clients. This caused bad ping for some servers in the lobby specifically.

In this version, this has been reduced to only once per second and only for
signs close to players.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed You can spawn inside a ravine or a lava/water lake (#89)
- Made sure all players are properly on ground before initializing the countdown
sequence
- Fixed Switching to spectator mode before game start may cause the spawn point
to be set in the air (#127)
- Fixed The pre-gen bar keeps showing when generating a new card ( #126)
- Fixed When spawning in, the player receives damage (#132)
- Fixed When rejoining, the coordinate display uses global coordinates until the
component is updated again (#131)

# 5.0-pre4

This is the fourth pre-release. This pre-release aims to further enhance the
custom HUD and fixes a critical bug causing some mobs to have no AI.

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Changelog
- Added new coordinate direction icon
- Added an option to hide the Bingo seed until the run is completed (#83)
- Improved fireworks effect
- Removed NOPEname from the credits room
- Added UnlucksMcGee to the credits room
- Made card generation sound play at 100% instead of 50%, to make it more in
line with other Bingo FX sounds

## New coordinate icon
The icon displayed next to the player coordinates now uses a textual "compass",
with letter abbreviations for cardinal directions by default.  
The Minecraft compass item icon from previous versions can still be enabled
using custom hud settings  
![compass_text](/images/5.0/compass_text.gif)

## Option to hide seed
As is common practice in speedrunning, there might be a case for a rule of not
letting the player know the Bingo Seed until run completion.

To facilitate this, there is now an HUD option to hide the seed until the run is
completed  
Specifically this means, after collecting all 25 items, or after returning to
the lobby.

Note that to properly hide your spawn location, you also should be careful about
showing F3, as this will reveal your actual location in the world as well. This
can be prevented to be triggered by accident by settingOptions -> Chat Settings
-> Reduced Debug Info to "ON".

Additionally, the seed is now hidden the same way before generating the first
Bingo card, instead of showing the seed icon.

## Better fireworks effect
When completing a goal, more fireworks spawn now and their spawning is spread over multiple ticks.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed  Some animals have NoAI:1 (#129)
- Firework damage on goal completion in certain scenarios (#55)


# 5.0-pre3

This is the third pre-release. This pre-release adds a new hud component and improves the bingo in-game menu, as well as providing some performance improvements.

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Changelog
- All seeds are shuffled once again, hopefully the last time in this development cycle for real now
- Implemented new bingo menu (#71) (Thanks to @UnlucksMcGee, #122)
- Added a new hud component for chunk coordinates (#39)
- Customized card generation sound and moved custom sound events to a separate slider
- Spawn points are now chunk-aligned: You always spawn on chunk coordinate 0 0 now. The spacing of spawn points is still roughly the same.
- Switched RNG to a simple LCG
- Optimized card generation
- Optimized terrain pre-generation

## Bingo Menu
There is a new in-game menu now for selecting options like going back to the lobby or switching to spectator mode.

1. On "Loading Terrain...", as well as hinting to the player about clicking the icon.
![chunk_coordinates.png](/images/5.0/menu_after_countdown.png)
 
2. On each item get (note the hover text when the mouse is over it)
![menu_item_get.png](/images/5.0/menu_item_get.png)
 
3. When the menu icon is clicked, it displays the bingo menu
![menu_item_get_click.png](/images/5.0/menu_item_get_click.png)
 
4. When you complete a goal, it just prints out the current menu options
![menu_goal_completion.png](/images/5.0/menu_goal_completion.png)
 
5. When you leave the game and then re-join
![menu_leave_and_rejoin.png](/images/5.0/menu_leave_and_rejoin.png)

## Chunk coordinate display
A new HUD component for displaying chunk coordinates has been added, which can
also be modified to only show chunk coordinates when holding a treasure map.
![chunk_coordinates.png](/images/5.0/chunk_coordinates.png)

Or with the setting changed while holding a treasure map it is shown instead of
regular coordinates:
![coordinates_holding_map.png](/images/5.0/coordinates_holding_map.png)

The spawn point is now chunk-aligned as well and you always spawn on chunk
coordinate 0 0. The spacing of possible spawn points is still the same overall.

## Sound changes
There is a new slider for Bingo FX sounds now.
![sound_slider.png](/images/5.0/sound_slider.png)

Additionally, the card generation sound changed. Previously, the vanilla sound for filling an item frame would play 25 times over each other, as items are being placed in the item frames for the lobby card.
Those sounds have been deactivated now and instead a single sound plays, which is also part of the new sound slider.

This slider replaces what is called "Voice/Speech" by default.

## Optimizations
Card generation is now a little bit faster, which may be noticeable if you are
generating a lot of cards in consecutive ticks for some reason

More noticeably, terrain pre-generation is now a lot faster. Chunks are no
longer immediately unloaded after generating them, which means that chunks that
are loaded for generating next to them generate a lot faster.  
On my machine the time terrain pre-generation takes is reduced down by ~35%
compared to pre2, however this figure may vary between systems.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug that meant that during card generation inconsistencies could happen
with the way items were picked
- Fixed  "Switch to spectator mode" being clickable in the lobby (#124)


# 5.0-pre2

This is the second pre-release. This pre-release aims to fix some more issues
and also tweaks gameplay a bit

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Changelog
- Card seeds are shuffled again to fix a bug that meant certain items would be
less likely than they were supposed to be (#117). This should hopefully be the
last time seeds change before release.
- Minor world gen tweaks
- Improved documentation in the lobby
- Improved resource pack check on servers
- Switching gamemodes is no longer prohibited after achieving a blackout (#104)
- There is an error message now when command blocks are disabled on a server
(#50)
- When switching teams, a check has been added to only make a player join who
recently pressed a button. Essentially, this should fix issues of the wrong
player getting assigned to a team
- Added credits for @Kri5t0fK and @gbegerow to the lobby
- CracaCG now has a Discord link when you click their sign in the lobby

## World generation changes
- Deep warm oceans generate more like warm oceans now, including sea pickles and
coral
- The cave frequency has been increased in badland type biomes
 
## Seed changes
A bug was fixed that meant that certain items would be less likely than they are
supposed to be under certain circumstances (details see #117).  
This includes all items that share a category with an item that has multiple
categories. All these items are now increased in frequency compared to
pre-release 1, and it should be more similar now to what it was in beta 1.

## Improvements to Resource Pack Check
- Additionally to checking if the Bingo resource pack is installed, there is now an additional check if the correct version is installed with a different message in case a wrong version is installed (#108).
- There is a different message now if the player downloads a non-release version from the master branch, which is disabled for releases.
- There is a hint that you might need to wait until the server resource pack was applied and then re-check again.

## Improvements to Lobby Documentation
- There is now an info in the goals book that you do not need to select a goal and all goals are always detected (some players where searching for a way in that book).
- There is information about sniper bingos now
- Changed gamerules are documented
- There is an explanation now what is being displayed in the category chests
- There is now a "Community & Support" book to the lobby which includes links to the issue tracker on github, the Discord server and my Twitter account.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Wrong players getting assigned to a team on button press.
- Fixed some strings being untranslatable #100
- Fixed  Saturation Effect is flickering in inventory while in lobby #105
- Fixed Card gen does not re-calculate weight after removing an item with multiple categories #117 
- Minor text & translation fixes

# 5.0-pre1

This is the first pre-release. Similarily to Minecraft Java, Pre-Release means
we are feature-complete and only some minor tweaks and bug fixes will be done
until the final release now.

Extensive testing in both multiplayer and single player would be appreciated.

## Changelog
- Added system to prevent accidental gamemode switches (#70)
- Biomes are now bigger compared to beta2 (but still small). This should
hopefully make melons and slimes more reliable.
- Added and removed some items
- Re-balanced item categories
- Added spacer to custom HUD
- Added Polish translation (by @Kri5t0fK in #99)
- Completed German translation (Resolves #62, by @gbegerow in #61)
- Players now don't lose hunger while in the lobby
- Rewrote card generation (all seeds and spawn points are different now)
- Added map icons

## Gamemode Switch System
There is a system in place now to prevent you from accidentally pressing F3+N or
F3+F4, switching your gamemode.  
You can still go to spectator mode by clicking a chat message, and once you did
that, you can switch to any other gamemode like usual, if you have operator
permissions.

If you do not like this system, you can also disable it by changing your
preferences in the lobby.

## Changes to the item pool
- Removed Beetroot Soup (was too unreliable with lower percentage in dungeons
compared to other dungeon items)
- Removed Crying Obsidian (Finding ruined portals was too unreliable)
- Removed Jungle Sapling (This is to prevent the jungle sapling from blocking
other jungle items and saplings at the same time while not adding a very
interesting item)
- Removed Snow Block (With iron block, snow block and bone block, there were too
many similar looking blocks. Snow layer is still in)
- Added Lead
- Added stonecutter
- Added orange concrete
- Added Pink Glazed Terracotta

Categories were also removed from some items, meaning you can get a greater
variety of item combinations now.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Map always thinks it's in multiplayer #67
- Fixed players sometimes taking suffocation damage upon spawn #75
- Fixed players sometimes being able to fall in front of lobby map
- Fixed Pre-gen lags out the game when you generate a new card while it is going
(#82) 
- Fixed You cannot return to the lobby when you are disconnected while a new
card is generated (#81) 
- Fixed Card generation is mathematically flawed (#74) 
- Fixed In the preferences menu, for the left column, some actions of the 2nd
component from the bottom are mismapped (#68)
- Fixed HUD components on the left render over the armor bar when the player has
an absorption effect (#69)

(#80)

- Fixed grayed out preference settings being clickable
- Fixed return to lobby text translation keys in goal announcement (#95) (by
@Kri5t0fK in #96)
- Fixed double bingo col&row - wrong order (#97) (by @Kri5t0fK in #98)
- Fixed Trigger bingo.card_pos not reset on game start (#77) 

# 5.0-beta2
## Changelog
- The custom hud can now be fully rearranged per player (#42)
- The custom hud now works with OptiFine (#8)
- There is a new coordinate hud component showing your x and z coordinates
relative to spawn (#65), and a compass that always points north (can be used to
figure out the direction of burried treasure with a map) (#41)
- The timer hud component is now per default on the left side and also includes
a minecraft clock icon showing in game time.
- The completed display for bingo cards got improved in readability
- The completed display for bingo cards now shows status for other teams as well
(#25)

  - in strict mode, players are put into advanture mode rather than survival
  - In strict mode, non-ops cannot interact with game controls
- On a server, you now get prompted for the resource pack (#52)

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Card display breaks with force unicode (#47)
- Fixed Players cannot unlock items in slots they unlocked in a previous game
when they are not logged in when generating a new card (#56)
- Fixed Timer visually starts before the players can move (#49)
- Fixed Card display doesn't work with OptiFine (#8)
- Fixed Chicken timers get ticked by pre-gen (#63)
- Fixed On a server with a server resource pack, the prompt will immediately
close due to the teleport to the lobby dimension (#52)
- Fixed Players who log off during a game will not be teleported to the lobby
and will only be able to unlock slots not unlocked in the previous game when
they re-join during an ongoing game (#57)
- Fixed Jump boost can cause players to lose health at the start (#51)
- Fixed The night is instantly skipped when leaving the bed (#60)

# 5.0-beta1

This marks the very first public release.

## Changelog
- Completely overhauled the lobby.
- Items have now weights in their categories. This is done to promote some more
unique items.
- New item: Slowness Arrows
- Worldgen: Biome distribution within one temperature zone is completely
overhauled. The generation now includes all vanilla biomes except rivers.

### Lobby
The lobby is completely revamped and looks entirely different.

Added a credits room featuring all playtesters and people who's stuff I used.
There is now a tutorial section for new players.
New setting: Automatically start pre-generation after generating a new card.

### Technical Changes
The lobby is now constructed used a dynamic array of structures.
You can register your own structures. Make sure they have an entrance centered
on the z coordinate. In case of non-symmetric rooms, fill one side with
emptiness as needed.

Items are now initialized to always have a count of one in the Minecraft item
tag and to add lore and a custom name based on its data.
Categories on items can now instead of a simple string array be an array of
compounds using an id field for the category name and a weight for a
category-specific weight.

## Fixes
- Fixed the game to continuously skipping to the next day when no player is in
the multi_noise dimension
  - This had the effect of starting on an arbitrary day, rather than day 0,
  causing it to not always be full moon for slimes.
- Fixed a bug which sometimes caused scheduled functions to lose their state.
(#38)
  - This caused issues like the countdown or per-generation to be interrupted.
- Fixed the pre-gen bossbar starting out filled after every game after the first
game.

# 5.0-alpha3.2
## Changelog
- Pre-generation progress is now displayed as a bossbar

## Fixes
- Fixed servers with low specs still crashing during pre-generation (#34)
- Fixed players respawning in the overworld after dying in the lobby without
having played a game yet (#35)
- Fixed a bug where you could get launched out of the skybox by getting punched
from other players (#36)


# 5.0-alpha3.1

## Fixes:
- Fixed the map crashing on servers during start game sequence

# 5.0-alpha3-ninja
Ninja update to correct the version displayed in the world selection screen

# 5.0-alpha3
## Changelog
- Disabled weather cycle (doesn't rain anymore)
- Added new items
- Removed Bell
- The item receive message now includes the count of total items
- A sniper bingo (a Bingo without any additional items) is now announced (#28)
- Removed pause detection (Time is real-time now and is counted even when the
game is paused)
- Disabled some rare spawn events
- The seed is now displayed as part of the hotbar display instead of the
sidebar.
- Actionbar Display is now refreshed only every second or when receiving an
item. That means that vanilla actionbar messages are now at least briefly
visible
- Added debug scoreboard for scheduled events to the sidebar. No value should
ever stay at 0.
- Technical improvements

## New Items
- Smoker
- Rabbit Hide
- Cooked Rabbit
- Dried Kelp Block
- Hay Bale
- Fletching Table
- Lectern
- Crying Obsidian
- Gold Block
- Scaffolding
- Piston
- Sticky Piston

## Disabled Spawn Events
- Phantoms
- Wandering Trader
- Pillager Patrols

All of these have in common that they either can only happen or become more
likely after a certain amount of days passed, giving players who use the same
world on multiple seeds an unfair advantage or disadvantage.

## Technical changes
- Switched to using NOPEName random
- Item registration received a refactor.

### Item registration
In order to add an item to the datapack, you only need to add it to the item
pool storage now. Extension packs that add new items now can register an own
function to a function tag to do so. This means multiple extension packs should
be compatible with each other in this regard.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed terrain not properly pre-generating before teleporting players
- Fixed emerald detection being unreliable (#11)
- Fixed signs sometimes showing language keys instead of the proper string (#12)
- Fixed being able to start a game before generating the first seed (#13)
- Fixed being able to start a game on the same seed without clearing the card by
requiring to generate a new card (#14)
- Fixed the lobby being mostly non-operational after a game ended, before
generating a random card (#19)
- Fixed not playing the item received sound for team members (#23)
- Fixed item frames not respawning right away in case they get destroyed somehow
(#24)
- Fixed players respawning in the overworld dimension after sleeping in a bed,
when the bed spawn became invalid (#26)
- Fixed players  being able to sprint jump off the skybox or the spawn
coordinate before the game started (#27)
- Fixed teammates being visible in the skybox (#29)
- Removed an accidentally released debug say 1 command

# 5.0-alpha2
## Changelog
- Added crafting tables to the lobby for an easy recipe lookup
- Decreased the area in front of the card display in the lobby where you receive
levitation and instead added barrier blocks. This improves recepie lookup as you
cannot interact with crafting tables when having the levitation effect.
- Added Heart of the Sea to the item pool
- Sea pickle and lime dye can no longer appear on the same map
- Worldgen changes
  - Decreased cave frequency (Vanilla: 1/7 chance, alpha1: 1/4. alpha2: 1/6)
  - Deep ocean biomes generate a lot sooner (Note: sea pickles do not generate
  in deep warm oceans)
  - Added Beaches to generation
 
## Bug Fixes
- Fixed old data influencing the items picked for the seed, causing seeds to be
not deterministic
- Fixed the top left spot being marked sometimes when receiving an item that is
not on the card (#7)
- Fixed levels from previous runs carrying over into the next run (#9)
- Fixed items that are in multiple categories sometimes appearing on a card
where they should not be able to.
- Fixed fireworks causing damage in caves (They spawn high enough to not damage
you now)

# 5.0-alpha1

First playable version, only handed to dedicated players.

This includes AmberWat's NegativeSpaces font resourcepack:
https://github.com/AmberWat/NegativeSpaceFont/releases  
Huge Thanks!

The file called Bingo.5.0.ALPHA.1.zip is a convenient world file. The Datapack
and Resourcepack are not needed separately. The Resourcepack is needed
separately for a server, though.
