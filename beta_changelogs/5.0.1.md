# 5.0.1-rc1

This is the first and hopefully only Release Candidate for Fetchr 5.0.1.

If no further issues are found with this version, there will be a release early
next week without any further changes.

## Changelog
- Minor performance improvements

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed bubble columns not getting replaced with dirt below spawn
- Fixed player position stopping to update under some circumstances
- Fixed shadow of colored text
- Prevent players from skipping the resource pack check manually by getting
teleported (This would mean the player still doesn't join games and is not
considered setup properly before)
